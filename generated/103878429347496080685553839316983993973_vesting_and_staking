Below is an example of how you might define a new Vesting ADO schema (separate from the “mytoken” and “sale” modules shown in your context) that achieves the requested functionality. It illustrates:

• Creating a unique vesting contract (ADO) per employee,  
• Enforcing a 6-month lockup,  
• Releasing tokens monthly at a 10% rate thereafter,  
• Automatically staking claimed tokens to a chosen validator,  
• Providing ownership-transfer steps so that each employee can ultimately control their own vesting app.

EXAMPLE USAGE FOR TWO EMPLOYEES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a high-level outline of how you could instantiate and configure two separate Vesting ADOs (one for each employee). For brevity, we assume both employees get the same schedule but with different addresses.

1. Instantiate Vesting ADO #1 for Employee A:
   - Msg: InstantiateMsg
     {
       "beneficiary": "andr1employeeA...",
       "token_address": "andr1token...",   
       "kernel_address": "andr1kernel...", 
       "total_amount": "100000000",          // Example total tokens
       "lockup_period": 15552000,            // ~ 6 months in seconds
       "monthly_release_percent": 0.1,       // 10% monthly
       "validator_address": "andr1validator",// Where tokens will be staked
       "owner": "andr1foundation..."         // (Optional) or your address if you’ll transfer ownership later
     }

2. Instantiate Vesting ADO #2 for Employee B:
   - Same format as above, except:
     {
       "beneficiary": "andr1employeeB...",
       ...
     }

3. Ownership Transfer Steps:
   - If you originally set yourself (or some other address) as the owner, you can transfer ownership to each employee so they fully control their own vesting contract.
     a) The current owner calls:
        ExecuteMsg → { "transfer_ownership": { "new_owner": "andr1employeeA..." } }
     b) Employee A finalizes the transfer by calling:
        ExecuteMsg → { "claim_ownership": {} }

   - Repeat similarly for Employee B. Now each employee has full control over their own Vesting ADO.

4. Claiming & Auto-Staking:
   - Once the lockup period expires (after 6 months), Employee A or B calls:
     ExecuteMsg → { "claim": {} }
   - The contract calculates the vested amount (based on 10% monthly releases), sends that portion as CW20 tokens to the vesting contract itself, and then automatically stakes them to "andr1validator". The employee can query at any time to see how many tokens remain locked.

This schema and flow provide:
• A 6-month lockup.  
• 10% monthly release thereafter.  
• Auto-staking of claimed tokens.  
• A clear ownership transfer process so each employee can own and manage their own vesting ADO.
