Below is an example of how you could set up and link four Andromeda modules to achieve your goal of selling event tickets as NFTs, accruing sales proceeds in a Timelock, and then distributing monthly commissions via a Conditional Splitter. The flow is:

1) A CW721 contract (“tickets”) mints event-ticket NFTs.  
2) A Marketplace contract lists these NFTs for sale (with proceeds going into a Timelock).  
3) The Timelock contract holds the sale proceeds until a specified date/time (e.g., month’s end).  
4) At the month’s end, you release the Timelock funds to a Conditional Splitter, which calculates the salesperson’s commission and sends the remainder to the company.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. CW721 (Tickets) Contract
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Below is a sample InstantiateMsg for your ticket NFT contract, based on the “cw721” schema shown in your context:

{
  "ado_type": "cw721",
  "description": "This CW721 contract represents event tickets.",
  "instantiate_msg": {
    "name": "EventTickets",
    "symbol": "TIX",
    "minter": "andr1owner... (your address or a controller)",
    "kernel_address": "andr1kerneladdress... (if using AMP features)",
    "owner": "andr1owner..."  // optional override, if different from sender
  }
}

Explanation:
• name / symbol: Basic metadata for your ticket collection.  
• minter: Who can mint new tickets (it could be your wallet or a specialized contract).  
• kernel_address: Required if using Andromeda’s kernel for cross-contract AMP messaging.  
• owner: Optional override of the contract’s owner field.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Marketplace Contract
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next, instantiate the Marketplace so that it sells only the tickets from the CW721 above and deposits all sale proceeds into the Timelock. In a typical workflow, you will do the following at sale time (via ExecuteMsg) so that any buyer’s payment is routed to the Timelock’s address.

InstantiateMsg example:

{
  "ado_type": "marketplace",
  "description": "Marketplace for selling event tickets.",
  "instantiate_msg": {
    "authorized_cw20_address": null,
    "authorized_token_addresses": [
      "andr1cw721tickets..." // the address of the CW721 contract once deployed
    ],
    "kernel_address": "andr1kerneladdress...", // same kernel if needed
    "owner": "andr1owner..." // optional override
  }
}

When you start a sale (by sending an NFT to the Marketplace using its ReceiveNft flow or by calling start_sale if the marketplace supports that directly), ensure the sale’s “recipient” is set to the Timelock contract address. For instance:

ExecuteMsg "receive_nft" (example):
{
  "receive_nft": {
    "sender": "andr1owner...",        // who is sending the NFT
    "token_id": "ticket_001",        // which ticket
    "msg": "<Base64-encoded StartSale data>"
  }
}

Within that StartSale message (decoded), you’d configure:
{
  "start_sale": {
    "coin_denom": {
      "native_token": "uandr"
      // or { "cw20_address": "..." } if selling via CW20
    },
    "price": "1000", // example price
    "recipient": "andr1timelock..." // The Timelock contract address
  }
}

This ensures that whenever someone buys "ticket_001" for 1000 uandr, the proceeds land in the Timelock.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Timelock Contract (Accrual until Month’s End)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instantiate a Timelock that holds the funds until the monthly release date/time.

{
  "ado_type": "timelock",
  "description": "Timelock for holding all ticket-sale proceeds until the end of each month.",
  "instantiate_msg": {
    "kernel_address": "andr1kerneladdress...",
    "owner": "andr1owner..." // you can be the owner to control release_funds
  }
}

When a buyer calls “buy” in the Marketplace, the sale proceeds will be transferred into this Timelock. To release funds after the monthly period elapses, you will call:

{
  "release_funds": {
    "recipient_addr": "andr1conditional_splitter...", // The address of your Splitter
    "start_after": null,
    "limit": null
  }
}

By default, the Timelock will not release anything until you (or an authorized party) execute release_funds. Optionally, you can attach an EscrowCondition (e.g., an expiration date at month’s end) when you hold_funds; then Timelock automatically becomes eligible to release at that time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Conditional Splitter (Scaling Commissions)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, a Conditional Splitter can compute how much goes to the salesperson vs. the company based on the total monthly sales. This is an illustrative InstantiateMsg for a hypothetical “conditional_splitter” ADO type (not shown in your provided context, but commonly used in Andromeda for tiered payouts). Adjust to match your real contract’s schema:

{
  "ado_type": "conditional_splitter",
  "description": "Splits monthly Timelock withdrawals between a salesperson and the company, with tiered commissions.",
  "instantiate_msg": {
    "kernel_address": "andr1kerneladdress...",
    "owner": "andr1owner...",
    "tiers": [
      // Example tier thresholds in total monthly sales (uandr)
      { "threshold": "1000000", "commission_rate": "0.10" }, // 10% if under 1,000,000 in total sales
      { "threshold": "5000000", "commission_rate": "0.15" }, // 15% for 1M–5M
      { "threshold": "10000000","commission_rate": "0.20" }, // 20% for 5M–10M
      { "threshold": null,      "commission_rate": "0.25" }  // 25% if over 10M
    ],
    "addresses": {
      "salesperson": "andr1salesperson...",
      "company": "andr1company..."
    }
  }
}

When the Timelock calls release_funds to this contract (by specifying recipient_addr = "andr1conditional_splitter..."), the Splitter can:  
• Determine how much was just received and add it to the running total for the month.  
• Based on the total monthly sales so far, pick the appropriate commission rate.  
• Transfer that commission to the salesperson.  
• Transfer the remainder to the company.  

(Implementation details may vary depending on how you track “monthly” totals, e.g. resetting after each distribution or storing state. Some Andromeda-based splitter contracts let you define tiered rules; if not, you’d create a custom logic ADO that performs exactly this function.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Putting It All Together
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Deploy the cw721 (ticket) contract.  
• Deploy the Timelock.  
• Deploy the Conditional Splitter.  
• Deploy the Marketplace, authorizing the cw721 contract.  

Flow of Funds:  
1) You (or an admin) mint tickets in the cw721 contract.  
2) You start sales on the Marketplace (recipient set to the Timelock).  
3) Buyers purchase tickets; the Marketplace sends the payment to the Timelock.  
4) At month’s end, call release_funds on Timelock to send all accrued proceeds to the Conditional Splitter.  
5) The Conditional Splitter calculates how to split commission vs. remainder and transfers accordingly.  

With these pieces in place, you achieve:  
• NFT-based tickets.  
• Sales proceed accrual in Timelock until end-of-month.  
• Tiered commission distribution to salesperson vs. company at release time.

This high-level configuration (CW721 + Marketplace + Timelock + Conditional Splitter) provides a template for your Andromeda-based application that sells event tickets with monthly commission payouts. Adjust addresses, thresholds, and additional logic as needed for your exact business rules.
