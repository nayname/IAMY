Below is a minimal instantiation schema for a CW20 token named “MyProjectToken,” using symbol “MPT,” with 0 decimals, and the user as the unlimited minter (no cap). You may substitute placeholder addresses (e.g. "YOUR_ADDRESS") with the desired values:

{
  "name": "MyProjectToken",
  "symbol": "MPT",
  "decimals": 0,
  "initial_balances": [],
  "mint": {
    "minter": "YOUR_ADDRESS",
    "cap": null
  },
  "marketing": null,
  "kernel_address": "",
  "owner": "YOUR_ADDRESS"
}
