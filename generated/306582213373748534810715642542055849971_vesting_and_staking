Below is a simplified example of how you might configure two ADOs on Andromeda—one for vesting and one for staking—so that your tokens are locked for one year, released in increments, and then automatically staked in the default validator upon release. In practice, you should adapt these schemas to match the exact ADO implementations and field names used in your Andromeda environment. The following example illustrates a conceptual configuration often seen in Vesting and Staking contracts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Vesting ADO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

{
  "name": "my_vesting_contract",
  "ado_type": "vesting",
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Vesting contract locking tokens for one year, then releasing gradually, auto-staking on release",
    "owner": "andr1owner..." 
  },
  "instantiate_msg": {
    /* 
      The denom represents which token is being vested (often "uandr" or another native denom).
      total_amount is the total tokens to be vested.
      The schedule below shows a one-year lockup followed by incremental release.
      Once released, the tokens will be sent to the Staking ADO (via a post-release action).
    */
    "denom": "uandr",
    "total_amount": "100000000",         

    "beneficiary": "andr1beneficiary...", 
    "start_time": 1696117800,    
    /* 
      One-year lock. No tokens can be withdrawn from the vesting contract until this date.
      For example, 1696117800 is a placeholder Unix timestamp approximately one year from now.
    */
    "cliff_end_time": 1696117800,        
    /* 
      The schedule for gradually releasing tokens (e.g., monthly increments):
      - end_time = start_time + 1 year in seconds
      - release_increments might use durations or a precomputed set of intervals
    */
    "end_time": 1727653800,           
    "release_increments": {
      "num_increments": 12,            /* e.g., monthly release over the year after cliff ends */
      "release_unit": "month"          /* or a time in seconds, e.g., 2592000 sec for 30 days */
    },

    /* 
      post_release_action instructs the contract to automatically stake any released tokens
      by calling your Staking ADO. This can be structured differently depending on the ADO,
      but the high-level idea is to configure an action or callback to the Staking contract.
    */
    "post_release_action": {
      "stake": {
        "staking_ado_address": "my_staking_contract"
      }
    }
  }
}

Explanation:

• ado_type: "vesting" – Identifies this ADO as a Vesting contract.  
• metadata.owner – Whomever controls or can update this contract.  
• denom – The native coin or token to be vested.  
• total_amount – Total tokens to lock up in the vesting schedule.  
• start_time & cliff_end_time – When vesting (and the lock) begins, and when the tokens can begin to be released.  
• end_time – When vesting finishes (after incremental releases).  
• release_increments – Specified as either total increments, increment intervals in seconds, or other structured schedule.  
• post_release_action – An example field that, upon token release, directs the contract to call out to your Staking contract and stake the newly released tokens.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Staking ADO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

{
  "name": "my_staking_contract",
  "ado_type": "staking",
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Default Staking contract for automatically staking released tokens",
    "owner": "andr1owner..."
  },
  "instantiate_msg": {
    /* 
      The denom is required for many staking modules (usually a native token).
      validator represents the default validator address where staking occurs.
    */
    "denom": "uandr",
    "validator": "andrvaloper1default..."
  }
}

Explanation:

• ado_type: "staking" – Identifies this ADO as a Staking contract.  
• denom – The native coin or token it stakes.  
• validator – The default validator address where tokens should be staked.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wiring Vesting to Staking
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the vesting configuration above, "post_release_action" (or an equivalent callback mechanism) ensures that any newly vested tokens are sent directly to your Staking contract’s “stake” method, thus automating the stake process. Depending on your exact ADO framework, you might need to verify or adjust:

• The method name the Vesting contract calls on the Staking contract (e.g., “stake_tokens”, “bond”, “stake”, etc.).  
• Any authentication requirements (the vesting contract may need permission/allowance to send tokens to the staking contract).  
• The exact name and structure of “post_release_action” or callback messages used by your chosen ADO implementations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Putting It All Together
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Deploy your Vesting ADO with the required amount of tokens (via an “Instantiate” message or by sending tokens to the contract upon instantiation, depending on your setup).  
2) Once the Vesting ADO is live, it enforces the one-year lock and subsequent monthly (or chosen period) release schedule.  
3) As tokens release from cliff and increments, the Vesting ADO triggers a message to the Staking ADO to immediately stake those released tokens.  
4) The Staking ADO then stakes the tokens to the specified default validator.

This combined approach satisfies the requirement of a one-year lock, gradual releases, and immediate staking upon release. You would customize details—timestamps, number of increments, token denominations, etc.—to match your specific needs and Andromeda’s official Vesting/Staking contract interfaces.
