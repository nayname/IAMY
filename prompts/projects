You are helping me design a focused go-to-market strategy for an early-stage
open-source infrastructure project.

### 1. Project description (context you must keep consistent)

The project is an external execution layer for AI/LLM-driven interfaces.

It is NOT an autonomous agent framework.

The core idea:
When an LLM sits on the execution path between a user interface
(docs, dashboards, admin panels) and backend actions (APIs, CLIs, transactions),
there is a “leap of trust” problem.

The project introduces a deterministic execution boundary:
intent → explicit execution plan → preview → user confirmation → execution → audit.

The goal is to make LLM-initiated actions:
- predictable
- reviewable
- non-autonomous
- safe for irreversible or high-stakes environments

Typical surfaces:
- documentation agents
- internal dashboards
- admin panels
- infra tooling
- blockchain / financial systems

---

### 2. What kinds of GitHub projects I want to find

Find open-source GitHub projects that satisfy MOST of the following:

A) Architecture
- LLM or agent is involved in translating user intent into backend actions
- Flow resembles: frontend → LLM/agent → backend / side effects

B) Risk / ownership
- Actions are irreversible, costly, or operationally sensitive
- Someone clearly “owns” consequences (infra, ops, platform teams)

C) Maturity
- Active maintainers
- Real users (not demo-only, not research toys)
- Not FAANG-locked or closed ecosystems

D) Signal
- Issues or Discussions mention:
  - safety
  - trust
  - approval
  - dry-run
  - permissions
  - tool-calling risks
  - MCP / agent execution concerns
- Or evidence of hacked-in safeguards (prompts, manual confirmation, TODOs)

Explicitly exclude:
- consumer chatbots
- content-generation tools
- autonomous demo agents
- repos with “do not use in prod” everywhere

---

### 3. How to evaluate and sort projects

For each candidate project, score (0–2 each):

1. LLM on execution path
2. Irreversible / risky backend actions
3. Clear maintainer ownership
4. Evidence of trust/safety concern
5. Architectural friction around execution

Only keep projects scoring **≥7/10**.

For each selected project, output:
- Repo name + link
- One-sentence description
- Why execution trust is a real issue here
- Where the signal appears (Issue / Discussion / README)
- Whether it is better suited for:
  - docs surface
  - dashboard / admin surface
  - internal tooling

---

### 4. Day-by-day GTM plan (10 days)

Divide the work into a **10-day GTM plan**, with each day having:
- a concrete goal
- a bounded task list
- a stopping condition

Use this structure:

Day 1–2: Discovery
- Identify and shortlist high-signal repos
- No outreach yet

Day 3–4: Deep signal validation
- Read issues / discussions
- Extract exact language maintainers use around trust & safety

Day 5–6: Mapping & positioning
- Map each repo to the project’s execution-layer value
- Decide: comment publicly vs email vs do nothing

Day 7–8: Outreach (lightweight)
- Draft GitHub-native comments or short emails
- One project per message
- No follow-ups, no selling, no meeting asks

Day 9: Synthesis
- Identify patterns:
  - repeated objections
  - repeated pain points
  - repeated misunderstandings

Day 10: Decision checkpoint
- Based on signals, decide:
  - continue this GTM lane
  - pivot target surface
  - stop this path

---

### 5. Output format

Produce:
1. A ranked list of GitHub projects (max 15)
2. A table with scores and reasoning
3. The 10-day GTM plan
4. A short summary of what signals would indicate:
   - strong pull
   - weak pull
   - dead end

Do NOT:
- hype
- invent traction
- suggest VC fundraising
- suggest Reddit / YC forums
- suggest mass outreach

Be conservative, realistic, and operator-oriented.
