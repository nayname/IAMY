BTC Summer
Campaign Details
Complete guide to BTC Summer campaign mechanics, phases, rewards, and participation requirements

Bitcoin Summer is a multi-phase campaign in partnership with Lombard, EtherFi, Solv, Bedrock, Wrapped Bitcoin, Structured, Valence, Mars, Amber Finance, and Babylon that brings real yield opportunities to BTC and unlocks leveraged BTC looping for the first time. The campaign distributes up to $10M in NTRN rewards, in addition to partner airdrops, over multiple phases to participants who provide liquidity and engage with Neutron’s DeFi protocols.
Neutron is uniquely positioned thanks to three innovations:
maxBTC
A high, real yield BTC derivative. MaxBTC has been live for > 230 days with an average BTC APY of ~10% before incentives.
Supervaults
Advanced automated market makers that leverage in-consensus oracles to protect LPs from loss while offering best execution to traders.
AmberFi
A secure and efficient isolated lending/borrowing protocol for Bitcoin derivatives. Documentation →
For users, this campaign represents an opportunity to:
Earn sustainable risk-adjusted BTC rewards without the hassle of frequently cycling through ecosystem campaigns.
Manage your exposure according to your preferences: from most conservative (lending yields) to most aggressive (Leveraged Looped MaxBTC positions).
For detailed reward and incentive mechanics, see Rewards Guide. For important eligibility requirements and campaign terms, please review Bitcoin Summer Campaign Terms.
​
Campaign Structure
​
Phases & Timeline
The campaign is structured in successive 2-month phases, with at least 6 phases planned (12+ months total duration). Each phase has predetermined parameters set before launch:
Phase Budget: Dollar value distributed as incentives (e.g., Phase 1: $250,000 in NTRN Rewards)
Eligible Opportunities: List of participating vaults and protocols
NTRN Reward Multipliers: Boost mechanisms and qualification criteria
Earlier phases have smaller budgets to account for initial visibility, while later phases scale up to drive broader participation.
Breakdown of campaign timeline and epochs
​
How Rewards Work
The campaign rewards actual DeFi positions on Neutron, not just vault deposits. This means:
Vault participants receive pro-rata shares of rewards earned by their vault’s underlying positions
Direct participants earn rewards by depositing directly into eligible Neutron protocols
Tiered accounting ensures fair distribution across multiple layers of deposits
Whether you deposit through Ethereum vaults or directly on Neutron, you’re earning rewards from the same underlying DeFi positions.
​
Dollar-Denominated Rewards
Unlike traditional token farming, rewards are calculated in dollar terms throughout each phase and converted to NTRN tokens at phase end based on the final NTRN price.
Example:
Alice deposits 1 BTC ($100,000) at phase start
Earns $1,660 in rewards over 2 months (~10% APR)
At phase end, if NTRN = $1, Alice receives ~1,660 NTRN tokens
This structure means campaign costs decrease if NTRN price appreciates, aligning incentives with network growth.
Points System

​
Reward Claiming & Vesting
After each Bitcoin Summer phase ends, participants have three options to claim NTRN rewards:
Boost & Earn Staking Rewards: Stake and lock instantly to boost NTRN rewards in upcoming phases by up to 3x and earn NTRN staking rewards
Instant Claim: Instantly claim 50% and forfeit the other 50%
Standard Vesting: Vest over 2 months to claim the full amount
The vesting mechanism promotes long-term ecosystem participation and prevents sudden token supply releases.
​
Vault Rewards Model
​
Soft-Lock Structure
Campaign vaults use a “forfeitable” reward structure to encourage full phase participation:
Component	Terms	Details
Principal	No lockup	Your principal remains fully liquid at all times.
DeFi Rewards	No lockup	Market making spreads and lending yields are automatically compounded into your position and can be withdrawn at any time.
NTRN Rewards	Forfeitable	Withdrawing mid-Phase forfeits that Phase’s rewards.
Partner Aidrops	No lockup by default	In general, BTC LST Issuers do not enforce forfeitable incentives. We encourage you to reach out to the relevant asset issuers to confirm their approach.
Example: If you deposit 10 BTC at phase start but withdraw 5 BTC mid-phase, you forfeit rewards corresponding to the withdrawn amount.

​
Asset Yield
Asset Yield is the yield generated by the vault’s underlying assets. There are two primary sources:
maxBTC (5-10% APR)

MaxBTC generates BTC denominated yields by syndicating the best strategies under a single yield-bearing asset. maxBTC yield is auto-compounded into the price of the asset, so holders don’t need to claim rewards. The protocol’s first strategy is a hedged JLP liquidity provisioning strategy with the following yield sources:
Learn more about maxBTC: Structured Documentation
Jupiter LP APY: Generated from fees accrued through Jupiter’s perpetual trading activities—including fees for opening/closing positions, price impact, borrowing, and trading—while excluding asset appreciation and traders’ PnL. These fees are redistributed to JLP holders on an hourly basis, resulting in an APY that typically ranges from high single-digit percentages to as much as 40%.
Hedging APY: Generated by rebalancing positions whenever the JLP trades at a discount or premium relative to its BTC valuation. Typically, this process yields a positive annual return of approximately 0.5%.
Funding rate costs: Arise from hedging positions on centralized exchanges (CEXs). Historically, this rate has ranged between -1% and -4%, but during extreme market conditions, it can become positive, thereby contributing an extra layer of APY protection.
Bitcoin Staking (0.4% APR)

Certain BTC LSTs accrue BABY tokens and other rewards for the security they provide via Babylon’s Bitcoin Staking platform.
​
DeFi Yield
Generated by the productive use of vault deposits, DeFi yields are denominated in the vault’s deposit asset and continuously autocompounded into the position.
They are primarily generated by two activities:
Market making on correlated markets via the network’s Supervaults.
Lending on Amber (Bitcoin-focused isolated lending/borrowing protocol)
​
Partner Rewards
Lombard, Solv, Bedrock, EtherFi, Structured, Mars, and Amber will airdrop tokens to depositors in eligible Bitcoin Summer vaults.
How it works:
Earn points for specific actions during BTC Summer participation
The more points you collect, the bigger your airdrop
All partners have committed their maximum points multiplier, giving BTC Summer participants the chance to maximize their rewards
To verify the number of points earned during the campaign, users can check the respective partner’s application. For more information on how each airdrop program works, follow the links below:
Partner	Scope	Multiplier	Points Program
Lombard	LBTC	4x	Lombard Lux (max multiplier)
Solv	SolvBTC	4x	Solv Points (max multiplier)
Bedrock	uniBTC	3x	Bedrock Diamonds (max multiplier)
EtherFi	eBTC	3x	EtherFi Points (max multiplier)
Structured	MaxBTC	TBC	Structured Points
AmberFi	All BRT Deposits	3x-4x (varies by BRT)	Mars Fragments
​
Neutron Rewards
An initial $10M in NTRN rewards (max 10% of supply) is earmarked for the campaign. Rewards will be distributed as USD Value, and converted into NTRN at the time of claiming to preserve value and prevent dilution.
Example

Bob deposits 1 wBTC worth $100,000 to a campaign vault earning $1,000 per day during the Phase. Each day, Bob’s accrued rewards increase by $1,000. Bob holds his position until the end of the Phase, by which point he has accumulated $60,000 in rewards.
At the time of claiming, Bob’s $60,000 reward is converted into NTRN at the latest price, and either locked or transferred to his wallet or the vesting contract depending on his claiming choice.

NTRN Rewards Multipliers
Different DeFi activities earn different NTRN reward multipliers, with higher-risk or more strategic positions earning greater rewards:
Multiplier	Activity
6x	LP in the maxBTC/USDC Supervault
5x	LP in the WBTC/USDC Supervault
4x	LP in the maxBTC/WBTC Supervault

Boost Pointing & Address Linking
You can only boost 1 address at a time. Updating your boost target automatically updates all previous boosts to the new address.
​
Proper Boost Pointing
Essential requirement: Point your boost to the address where you deposited TVL.
UI Guidance:
Ethereum vault depositors: Select “Link an address” → Enter your EVM address
Direct Neutron depositors: Select “Boost this wallet” → Boosts your Neutron address
Important: “Boost this wallet” always boosts your currently connected Neutron wallet, regardless of where you deposited.
​
Address Linking Process
1
Acquire NTRN

Get NTRN tokens through exchanges, swaps, or bridges. See our User Quickstart Guide for detailed instructions on acquiring NTRN.
2
Choose Lock Parameters

Select lock amount and duration (up to 4 years for maximum boost)
3
Specify Target Address

Critical:
“Boost this wallet”: Boosts your connected Neutron wallet (only use if you deposited on Neutron)
“Link an address”: Specify your EVM deposit address (use this if you deposited via Ethereum vaults)
4
Confirm Lock

Complete the transaction and receive your receipt NFT
5
Verify Boost

Check that boost is correctly applied to your deposit address
Important: The boost only works if properly pointed to your deposit address. Incorrect pointing means no boost benefits.
​
NTRN Reward Calculation Examples
Example 1: Basic Participation

Deposit: 1 BTC ($100,000) for full phase (60 days)
No boost: Standard 1x multiplier
Points: $100,000 × 60 × 1 = 6,000,000 points
Estimated rewards: Based on your share of total points
Example 2: With NTRN Staking

Deposit: 1 BTC ($100,000) for full phase
NTRN staked: $50,000 worth for 2 years
Boost calculation: (50,000/100,000) × (2/4) × 2 = 0.5 boost
Total multiplier: 1 + 0.5 = 1.5x
Points: $100,000 × 60 × 1.5 = 9,000,000 points
Example 3: Maximum Boost

Deposit: 1 BTC ($100,000) for full phase
NTRN staked: $200,000 worth for 4 years
Boost calculation: (200,000/100,000) × (4/4) × 2 = 4.0, capped at 2.0
Total multiplier: 1 + 2.0 = 3x
Points: $100,000 × 60 × 3 = 18,000,000 points
​
Strategy and Risk Considerations
​
Lending Strategies (Amber Protocol)
Lenders provide overcollateralized loans to BTC borrowers who use tokens like maxBTC as collateral to borrow from the lending supply. The liquidation system ensures collateral tokens are liquidated at greater value than the debt being repaid.
Risk Profile:
Lower drawdown risk: More protected against maxBTC drawdowns than direct holders due to overcollateralization
Reduced yield: Take less yield in exchange for lower drawdown risk
Key risks: Smart contract risk and potential delayed liquidations
Risk mitigation: Liquidators are incentivized with bonuses for quick debt repayment
​
Market Making Strategies (Supervaults)
LPs provide bid and ask quotes at the most recent centralized exchange price as reported by Neutron’s enshrined oracle. Supervaults take a spread on every trade as a buffer against oracle pricing risks.
Risk Profile:
Oracle dependency: Risk that oracle misreports price or is slightly outdated
Spread protection: Trading spreads act as buffer against oracle timing issues
Market making exposure: Subject to typical LP risks (impermanent loss, market volatility)
Risk mitigation: Automated rebalancing and tight spread management

What is Amber Finance?
Amber

Amber Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform focused on unlocking yield for Bitcoin holders using Bitcoin Liquid Staking Tokens. These include tokenized or staked representations of BTC that can be used in DeFi without sacrificing exposure to Bitcoin itself.

What Amber Enables
Leveraged Yield Generation through underlying staking mechanisms
Leveraged Points Farming with Mars Fragments and Neutron Rewards
Transparent and On-Chain Leverage including looping strategies with up to 12x leverage
Seamless Asset Swaps across supported Bitcoin LSTs with minimal slippage
Governance & Transparency
Amber Finance operates under a Multisig DAO on Neutron , where community members can view treasury holdings and transactions transparently on-chain.

Note: All revenue generated by Amber Finance contributes to the Mars Protocol Foundation (MPF) , aligning incentives with the broader Mars ecosystem.

What are Bitcoin Liquid Staking Tokens?
Bitcoin Liquid Staking Tokens are tokenized representations of Bitcoin that enable BTC holders to participate in DeFi activities while maintaining exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements. These tokens bridge the gap between Bitcoin’s store-of-value properties and the yield-generating opportunities available in decentralized finance.

Key Characteristics of Bitcoin LSTs
Bitcoin Exposure: Each Bitcoin LST maintains a 1:1 or near 1:1 relationship with Bitcoin’s price, ensuring holders retain their BTC exposure.

DeFi Compatibility: Unlike native Bitcoin, Bitcoin LSTs can be easily integrated into DeFi protocols for lending, borrowing, yield farming, and other financial activities.

Cross-Chain Functionality: Many Bitcoin LSTs operate across multiple blockchain networks, enabling seamless movement between different DeFi ecosystems.

Backed by Real Bitcoin: Most Bitcoin LSTs are backed by actual Bitcoin reserves, providing intrinsic value and reducing counterparty risk.

How Bitcoin LSTs Work
Tokenization Process: Bitcoin is locked in a secure vault or staking mechanism
Token Generation: An equivalent amount of Bitcoin LST tokens are minted and distributed
DeFi Integration: These tokens can then be used across various DeFi protocols
Redemption: Bitcoin LSTs can typically be redeemed for the underlying Bitcoin (subject to protocol rules)
Why Bitcoin LSTs Matter for DeFi
Capital Efficiency: Bitcoin holders can earn yield without selling their BTC
Risk Management: Diversified exposure across multiple Bitcoin-related protocols
Liquidity: Enhanced trading and lending opportunities for Bitcoin assets
Innovation: Enables new financial products and strategies for Bitcoin holders
Amber Finance aggregates these various Bitcoin LSTs, allowing users to access the best yield opportunities across the entire Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem through a single, unified platform.

Core Use Cases on Amber
Deposit & Earn
Put your Bitcoin LSTs to work immediately without lockups or complex processes
Start earning yield from day one
Yield Generation

DeFi on Neutron
Supervaults
Next-generation liquidity management vaults with automated rebalancing and capital-efficient yield strategies

Supervaults (mmvault contracts) are Neutron’s flagship DeFi innovation that manage liquidity on behalf of users by efficiently allocating deposits into the Neutron DEX (Duality). Using Neutron’s integrated infrastructure, they automatically rebalance positions across different price ranges and fee tiers, achieving maximal capital efficiency and improving outcomes for both traders and liquidity providers.
The vault contract abstracts away direct DEX interactions from end users, allowing users to interact through standardized deposit and withdrawal flows while the vault autonomously manages liquidity provisioning via Cron-triggered rebalancing logic.
Unlike traditional yield vaults or static liquidity pools, Supervaults actively optimize capital deployment to:
Minimize slippage for traders through concentrated liquidity
Maximize fees earned by liquidity providers across multiple fee tiers
Reduce impermanent loss through dynamic position management and rebalancing
For Liquidity Providers
Deposit paired tokens and receive LP share tokens representing proportional vault ownership. Earn optimized yields through strategic liquidity placement across price ranges and fee tiers.
For Traders
Supervaults provide deeper liquidity at current price points, resulting in significantly reduced slippage for large trades and better execution quality.
​
Capital Efficiency Advantages
Supervaults achieve exceptional capital efficiency through several mechanisms:
Concentrated Liquidity Management
Unlike passive AMMs, Supervaults actively concentrate liquidity around current market prices across multiple fee tiers, maximizing capital utilization.
Automated Fee Tier Optimization
The vault automatically allocates liquidity across different fee tiers based on market conditions, optimizing for both volume and fee generation.
Dynamic Rebalancing
Continuous rebalancing ensures liquidity stays optimally positioned as market conditions change, without requiring manual intervention.
Proportional Share System
The token factory-based LP share system ensures fair distribution of rewards and accurate tracking of user ownership through all rebalancing operations.
​
Comparison to Traditional Approaches
Feature	Standard AMM (e.g., Uniswap v2)	Concentrated Liquidity (e.g., Uniswap v3)	Neutron Supervaults
Liquidity Positioning	Passive, across infinite price range	Manual selection of price ranges	Automated dynamic positioning across multiple ranges
Fee Tier Management	Single fee tier	Manual fee tier selection	Automated allocation across multiple fee tiers
Rebalancing	None needed	Manual or via third-party services	Automated via Cron module every block
LP Experience	Simple but inefficient	Complex, requires active monitoring	Simple deposit with automated optimization
Oracle Integration	None	Third-party (if any)	Native Slinky oracle integration
Share Tracking	ERC-20 LP tokens	NFT positions	Token factory LP shares with proportional rewards
​
How Supervaults Work
Supervaults integrate with Neutron’s core modules to enable continuous, trustless operation:
​
User Flows
Deposit Process
Users deposit paired tokens (token0 and token1) and receive LP shares minted via Neutron’s token factory module, representing their proportional claim on the vault’s total value.
Withdrawal Process
Users redeem LP shares to withdraw their proportional share of vault assets. The vault handles complex DEX position management automatically during withdrawals.
​
Automated Rebalancing with Cron and Slinky Oracle
Slinky Oracle Integration
Supervaults leverage Neutron’s Slinky price oracle to fetch fresh price data for precise rebalancing calculations and liquidity positioning.
Two-Phase Rebalancing
The Cron module triggers a two-phase rebalancing process each block: first withdrawing all active positions, then redeploying liquidity based on current market conditions.
Multi-Tier Deployment
Liquidity is strategically deployed across different price ranges and fee tiers, optimizing for both capital efficiency and fee generation.
The complete rebalancing flow works as follows:
dex_withdrawal(): Each block, Cron first triggers withdrawal of all active DEX positions owned by the vault
dex_deposit(): Immediately after, it fetches fresh prices from Slinky oracle and recomputes optimal liquidity deployment
Strategic Positioning: Based on fee tier allocation, token imbalance, and configured parameters, liquidity is deployed across multiple price ranges
Full Custody: The vault maintains complete custody of all funds throughout the process
