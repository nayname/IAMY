The campaign distributes up to $10M in NTRN rewards, in addition to partner airdrops, over multiple phases to participants who provide liquidity and engage with Neutron\u2019s DeFi protocols.\nNeutron is uniquely positioned thanks to three innovations:\nmaxBTC\nA high, real yield BTC derivative. MaxBTC has been live for > 230 days with an average BTC APY of ~10% before incentives.\nSupervaults\nAdvanced automated market makers that leverage in-consensus oracles to protect LPs from loss while offering best execution to traders.\nAmberFi\nA secure and efficient isolated lending/borrowing protocol for Bitcoin derivatives. Documentation \u2192\nFor users, this campaign represents an opportunity to:\nEarn sustainable risk-adjusted BTC rewards without the hassle of frequently cycling through ecosystem campaigns.\nManage your exposure according to your preferences: from most conservative (lending yields) to most aggressive (Leveraged Looped MaxBTC positions).\nFor detailed reward and incentive mechanics, see Rewards Guide. For important eligibility requirements and campaign terms, please review Bitcoin Summer Campaign Terms.\n\u200b\nCampaign Structure\n\u200b\nPhases & Timeline\nThe campaign is structured in successive 2-month phases, with at least 6 phases planned (12+ months total duration). Each phase has predetermined parameters set before launch:\nPhase Budget: Dollar value distributed as incentives (e.g., Phase 1: $250,000 in NTRN Rewards)\nEligible Opportunities: List of participating vaults and protocols\nNTRN Reward Multipliers: Boost mechanisms and qualification criteria\nEarlier phases have smaller budgets to account for initial visibility, while later phases scale up to drive broader participation.\nBreakdown of campaign timeline and epochs\n\u200b\nHow Rewards Work\nThe campaign rewards actual DeFi positions on Neutron, not just vault deposits. This means:\nVault participants receive pro-rata shares of rewards earned by their vault\u2019s underlying positions\nDirect participants earn rewards by depositing directly into eligible Neutron protocols\nTiered accounting ensures fair distribution across multiple layers of deposits\nWhether you deposit through Ethereum vaults or directly on Neutron, you\u2019re earning rewards from the same underlying DeFi positions.\n\u200b\nDollar-Denominated Rewards\nUnlike traditional token farming, rewards are calculated in dollar terms throughout each phase and converted to NTRN tokens at phase end based on the final NTRN price.\nExample:\nAlice deposits 1 BTC ($100,000) at phase start\nEarns $1,660 in rewards over 2 months (~10% APR)\nAt phase end, if NTRN = $1, Alice receives ~1,660 NTRN tokens\nThis structure means campaign costs decrease if NTRN price appreciates, aligning incentives with network growth.\nPoints System\n\n\u200b\nReward Claiming & Vesting\nAfter each Bitcoin Summer phase ends, participants have three options to claim NTRN rewards:\nBoost & Earn Staking Rewards: Stake and lock instantly to boost NTRN rewards in upcoming phases by up to 3x and earn NTRN staking rewards\nInstant Claim: Instantly claim 50% and forfeit the other 50%\nStandard Vesting: Vest over 2 months to claim the full amount\nThe vesting mechanism promotes long-term ecosystem participation and prevents sudden token supply releases.\n\u200b\nVault Rewards Model\n\u200b\nSoft-Lock Structure\nCampaign vaults use a \u201cforfeitable\u201d reward structure to encourage full phase participation:\nComponent\tTerms\tDetails\nPrincipal\tNo lockup\tYour principal remains fully liquid at all times.\nDeFi Rewards\tNo lockup\tMarket making spreads and lending yields are automatically compounded into your position and can be withdrawn at any time.\nNTRN Rewards\tForfeitable\tWithdrawing mid-Phase forfeits that Phase\u2019s rewards.\nPartner Aidrops\tNo lockup by default\tIn general, BTC LST Issuers do not enforce forfeitable incentives. We encourage you to reach out to the relevant asset issuers to confirm their approach.\nExample: If you deposit 10 BTC at phase start but withdraw 5 BTC mid-phase, you forfeit rewards corresponding to the withdrawn amount.\nLearn more about NTRN multipliers in Boost Mechanisms & Multipliers\n\u200b\nChoose Your Participation Path\nComing from Ethereum\nBest for: Simple exposure with MetaMask and EVM wallets.

There are two primary sources:\nmaxBTC (5-10% APR)\n\nMaxBTC generates BTC denominated yields by syndicating the best strategies under a single yield-bearing asset. maxBTC yield is auto-compounded into the price of the asset, so holders don\u2019t need to claim rewards. The protocol\u2019s first strategy is a hedged JLP liquidity provisioning strategy with the following yield sources:\nLearn more about maxBTC: Structured Documentation\nJupiter LP APY: Generated from fees accrued through Jupiter\u2019s perpetual trading activities\u2014including fees for opening/closing positions, price impact, borrowing, and trading\u2014while excluding asset appreciation and traders\u2019 PnL. These fees are redistributed to JLP holders on an hourly basis, resulting in an APY that typically ranges from high single-digit percentages to as much as 40%.\nHedging APY: Generated by rebalancing positions whenever the JLP trades at a discount or premium relative to its BTC valuation. Typically, this process yields a positive annual return of approximately 0.5%.\nFunding rate costs: Arise from hedging positions on centralized exchanges (CEXs). Historically, this rate has ranged between -1% and -4%, but during extreme market conditions, it can become positive, thereby contributing an extra layer of APY protection.\nBitcoin Staking (0.4% APR)\n\nCertain BTC LSTs accrue BABY tokens and other rewards for the security they provide via Babylon\u2019s Bitcoin Staking platform.\n\u200b\nDeFi Yield\nGenerated by the productive use of vault deposits, DeFi yields are denominated in the vault\u2019s deposit asset and continuously autocompounded into the position.\nThey are primarily generated by two activities:\nMarket making on correlated markets via the network\u2019s Supervaults.\nLending on Amber (Bitcoin-focused isolated lending/borrowing protocol)\n\u200b\nPartner Rewards\nLombard, Solv, Bedrock, EtherFi, Structured, Mars, and Amber will airdrop tokens to depositors in eligible Bitcoin Summer vaults.\nHow it works:\nEarn points for specific actions during BTC Summer participation\nThe more points you collect, the bigger your airdrop\nAll partners have committed their maximum points multiplier, giving BTC Summer participants the chance to maximize their rewards\nTo verify the number of points earned during the campaign, users can check the respective partner\u2019s application.

Rewards will be distributed as USD Value, and converted into NTRN at the time of claiming to preserve value and prevent dilution.\nExample\n\nBob deposits 1 wBTC worth $100,000 to a campaign vault earning $1,000 per day during the Phase. Each day, Bob\u2019s accrued rewards increase by $1,000. Bob holds his position until the end of the Phase, by which point he has accumulated $60,000 in rewards.\nAt the time of claiming, Bob\u2019s $60,000 reward is converted into NTRN at the latest price, and either locked or transferred to his wallet or the vesting contract depending on his claiming choice.\nLearn more: Claiming NTRN Rewards\n\u200b\nNTRN Rewards Multipliers\nDifferent DeFi activities earn different NTRN reward multipliers, with higher-risk or more strategic positions earning greater rewards:\nMultiplier\tActivity\n6x\tLP in the maxBTC/USDC Supervault\n5x\tLP in the WBTC/USDC Supervault\n4x\tLP in the maxBTC/WBTC Supervault\n3x\tLend WBTC on Amber\n2x\t\nLP in the maxBTC/uniBTC Supervault\nLP in the maxBTC/solvBTC Supervault\nLP in the maxBTC/eBTC Supervault\nLP in the maxBTC/LBTC Supervault\nLend uniBTC, solvBTC, eBTC, or LBTC on Amber\nLP in the WBTC/uniBTC Supervault\nLP in the WBTC/solvBTC Supervault\nLP in the WBTC/eBTC Supervault\nLP in the WBTC/LBTC Supervault\nLend WBTC on Mars\n1x\tHold maxBTC\nKey Insights:\nHighest rewards (6x-5x): USDC paired strategies that provide crucial stablecoin liquidity\nHigh rewards (4x-3x): Core BTC strategies and WBTC lending\nStandard rewards (2x): LST strategies and cross-BTC derivative liquidity\nBase rewards (1x): Simple maxBTC holding for passive exposure\n\u200b\nNTRN Boost Mechanisms & Multipliers\n\u200b\nUnderstanding Multipliers\nBase concept: NTRN Rewards Multipliers increase your share of the total NTRN reward pool by boosting your points calculation.\nFormula:\nPoints\n=\nUSD Value\n\u00d7\nDays\n\u00d7\n(\n1\n+\nBoost Multiplier\n)\nPoints=USD Value\u00d7Days\u00d7(1+Boost Multiplier)\n\u200b\nNTRN Stake & Lock Boost\nBitcoin Summer participants can stake NTRN for up to 4 years to boost their Bitcoin Summer NTRN rewards up to 3x while earning staking rewards.\n\u200b\nHow It Works\nStake NTRN tokens for up to 4 years\nReceive a receipt NFT representing your staked position\nEarn 3% APR on locked NTRN through liquid staking with Drop\nGet boost multiplier based on lock amount and duration\n\u200b\nBoost Formula\nBoost\n=\nmin\n\u2061\n(\n2\n,\nNTRN\nLocked\nTVL\nDeposited\n\u00d7\nDuration\nuser\nDuration\nmax\n\u00d7\n2\n)\nBoost=min(2, \nTVL \nDeposited\n\u200b\n \nNTRN \nLocked\n\u200b\n \n\u200b\n \u00d7 \nDuration \nmax\n\u200b\n \nDuration \nuser\n\u200b\n \n\u200b\n \u00d72)\nKey factors:\nLocked NTRN amount relative to your BTC deposits\nLock duration (longer = higher boost)\nMaximum boost: 3x total rewards\n\u200b\nReceipt NFT Benefits\nTransferable: Can be traded on secondary markets (e.g., Superbolt)\nLiquid staking: Automatically stakes with Drop for additional 3% APR\nVisible tracking: Appears on app.neutron.org/staking\n\u200b\nBoost Pointing & Address Linking\nYou can only boost 1 address at a time.

The liquidation system ensures collateral tokens are liquidated at greater value than the debt being repaid.\nRisk Profile:\nLower drawdown risk: More protected against maxBTC drawdowns than direct holders due to overcollateralization\nReduced yield: Take less yield in exchange for lower drawdown risk\nKey risks: Smart contract risk and potential delayed liquidations\nRisk mitigation: Liquidators are incentivized with bonuses for quick debt repayment\n\u200b\nMarket Making Strategies (Supervaults)\nLPs provide bid and ask quotes at the most recent centralized exchange price as reported by Neutron\u2019s enshrined oracle. Supervaults take a spread on every trade as a buffer against oracle pricing risks.\nRisk Profile:\nOracle dependency: Risk that oracle misreports price or is slightly outdated\nSpread protection: Trading spreads act as buffer against oracle timing issues\nMarket making exposure: Subject to typical LP risks (impermanent loss, market volatility)\nRisk mitigation: Automated rebalancing and tight spread management\n\u200b\nAdditional Resources\nAmberFi\nAccess lending, leverage strategies, and explore all available Bitcoin DeFi opportunities.

Using Neutron\u2019s integrated infrastructure, they automatically rebalance positions across different price ranges and fee tiers, achieving maximal capital efficiency and improving outcomes for both traders and liquidity providers.\nThe vault contract abstracts away direct DEX interactions from end users, allowing users to interact through standardized deposit and withdrawal flows while the vault autonomously manages liquidity provisioning via Cron-triggered rebalancing logic.\nUnlike traditional yield vaults or static liquidity pools, Supervaults actively optimize capital deployment to:\nMinimize slippage for traders through concentrated liquidity\nMaximize fees earned by liquidity providers across multiple fee tiers\nReduce impermanent loss through dynamic position management and rebalancing\nFor Liquidity Providers\nDeposit paired tokens and receive LP share tokens representing proportional vault ownership. Earn optimized yields through strategic liquidity placement across price ranges and fee tiers.\nFor Traders\nSupervaults provide deeper liquidity at current price points, resulting in significantly reduced slippage for large trades and better execution quality.\n\u200b\nCapital Efficiency Advantages\nSupervaults achieve exceptional capital efficiency through several mechanisms:\nConcentrated Liquidity Management\nUnlike passive AMMs, Supervaults actively concentrate liquidity around current market prices across multiple fee tiers, maximizing capital utilization.\nAutomated Fee Tier Optimization\nThe vault automatically allocates liquidity across different fee tiers based on market conditions, optimizing for both volume and fee generation.\nDynamic Rebalancing\nContinuous rebalancing ensures liquidity stays optimally positioned as market conditions change, without requiring manual intervention.\nProportional Share System\nThe token factory-based LP share system ensures fair distribution of rewards and accurate tracking of user ownership through all rebalancing operations.\n\u200b\nComparison to Traditional Approaches\nFeature\tStandard AMM (e.g., Uniswap v2)\tConcentrated Liquidity (e.g., Uniswap v3)\tNeutron Supervaults\nLiquidity Positioning\tPassive, across infinite price range\tManual selection of price ranges\tAutomated dynamic positioning across multiple ranges\nFee Tier Management\tSingle fee tier\tManual fee tier selection\tAutomated allocation across multiple fee tiers\nRebalancing\tNone needed\tManual or via third-party services\tAutomated via Cron module every block\nLP Experience\tSimple but inefficient\tComplex, requires active monitoring\tSimple deposit with automated optimization\nOracle Integration\tNone\tThird-party (if any)\tNative Slinky oracle integration\nShare Tracking\tERC-20 LP tokens\tNFT positions\tToken factory LP shares with proportional rewards\n\u200b\nHow Supervaults Work\nSupervaults integrate with Neutron\u2019s core modules to enable continuous, trustless operation:\n\u200b\nUser Flows\nDeposit Process\nUsers deposit paired tokens (token0 and token1) and receive LP shares minted via Neutron\u2019s token factory module, representing their proportional claim on the vault\u2019s total value.\nWithdrawal Process\nUsers redeem LP shares to withdraw their proportional share of vault assets. The vault handles complex DEX position management automatically during withdrawals.\n\u200b\nAutomated Rebalancing with Cron and Slinky Oracle\nSlinky Oracle Integration\nSupervaults leverage Neutron\u2019s Slinky price oracle to fetch fresh price data for precise rebalancing calculations and liquidity positioning.\nTwo-Phase Rebalancing\nThe Cron module triggers a two-phase rebalancing process each block: first withdrawing all active positions, then redeploying liquidity based on current market conditions.\nMulti-Tier Deployment\nLiquidity is strategically deployed across different price ranges and fee tiers, optimizing for both capital efficiency and fee generation.\nThe complete rebalancing flow works as follows:\ndex_withdrawal(): Each block, Cron first triggers withdrawal of all active DEX positions owned by the vault\ndex_deposit(): Immediately after, it fetches fresh prices from Slinky oracle and recomputes optimal liquidity deployment\nStrategic Positioning: Based on fee tier allocation, token imbalance, and configured parameters, liquidity is deployed across multiple price ranges\nFull Custody: The vault maintains complete custody of all funds throughout the process\n\u200b\nGet Started with Supervaults\nDeposit Assets\nProvide paired token liquidity to earn optimized yields with fully automated management\nView Analytics\nMonitor performance metrics, yield statistics, and rebalancing activity\nTrade with Low Slippage\nExecute large trades with minimal price impact thanks to concentrated liquidity\n\u200b\nTechnical Architecture\nUser Deposits Token0 & Token1\n\nSupervault Contract\n\nMint LP Shares via Token Factory\n\nUser Receives LP Shares\n\nCron Module\n\ndex_withdrawal Function\n\nWithdraw All Active DEX Positions\n\ndex_deposit Function\n\nSlinky Oracle\n\nCalculate Target Tick & Fee Tiers\n\nDeploy Liquidity via MsgDeposit\n\nDuality DEX Positions\n\nGenerate Trading Fees\n\nUser Withdraws\n\nBurn LP Shares\n\nReturn Proportional Assets\n\nTechnical Implementation: Supervaults represent the cutting edge of automated market making, combining Neutron\u2019s integrated modules (Cron, Slinky Oracle, Token Factory, and Duality DEX) into a unified liquidity management system that operates trustlessly without external dependencies.\nDuality Orderbook\nBull vs. Bear\nAsk a question...\n",
