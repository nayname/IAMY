This was a transformative innovation. However, these AMMs were extremely capital inefficient, meaning that a significant amount of the liquidity deposited in them was not used. This led to extremely high price impact (aka slippage) for traders.\n- Line 14: Orderbooks are the dominant trading mechanism of traditional finance, and involve a set of limit orders that can be filled by other traders and market makers. They are extremely capital efficient: limit orders, by definition, have zero price impact for traders. While they offer a familiar UX and capital efficient trading experience, they are extremely computationally inefficient to implement on-chain, and don't offer the same liveness and composability properties that make AMMs a core DeFi primitive.\n- Line 27: **A Quick Note on Fees and Value Accrual**\n- Line 29: Concentrated liquidity and orderbooks differ slightly in how liquidity providers accrue value. On concentrated liquidity AMMs, liquidity providers accrue value through a [fee](/developers/modules/dex/concepts/fees) that they choose when placing the liquidity. The fee is a predetermined premium that traders pay when using the liquidity to swap between two assets.\n- Line 31: Orderbook liquidity providers accrue value through maintaining a bid-ask spread, which entails them offering to sell assets slightly above the current price and buy them slightly below the current price. It turns out that these two mechanism are actually very similar in that they describe the difference in prices between the best sell and buy prices.\n\n**Content Preview:**\n```\n\nAMMs were the first time that capital markets were created on-chain, in a computationally efficient manner.
