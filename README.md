LLM-based Smart Contract Generator
=======================

This repository contains an open-source Web 3.0 project leveraging advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform user intents, expressed in natural language, into CosmWasm smart contracts. Accelerate your decentralized app development.

**Note**: The code generated by the LLM is currently of _limited quality_, often containing ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù or incomplete logic.

üìö Project Overview
----------------

When creating decentralized applications with CosmWasm framework, developers regularly need to craft and deploy smart contracts customized to their specific business requirements. This project addresses this challenge by:

*   Accepting a user‚Äôs intent in natural language (e.g., ‚ÄúI want an NFT marketplace that charges a commission to sellers‚Äù).
    
*   Processing that intent through a Large Language Model.
    
*   Generating an initial smart contract draft matching the described functionality.
    
  

üß© Supported Object Types
-------------------

This project currently supports generating code for the following object types (based on Andromeda Digital Objects):

*   **marketplace** A decentralized marketplace smart contract built on the Cosmos blockchain using CosmWasm. 
    
*   **cw20** CW20 is a specification for fungible tokens based on CosmWasm.
    
*   **auction** CosmWasm smart contract implementing auction logic
    
*   **cw721** CW721 is a specification for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) based on CosmWasm.
    
*   **timelock** smart contract built to hold funds (Native coins) for a period of time until the set condition is satisfied. 
    
*   **cw20 exchange** The CW20 Exchange is used to sell CW20 tokens for other assets.
  
*   **splitter** The Splitter is a smart contract used to split funds to a preset number of addresses.  
  
*   **crowdfund** A crowdfund contract that allows users to pledge tokens to reach a funding goal.  

üíæ  Usage
-----

To generate test examples:

```console
python create.py
```

The scripts are located in the /generated directory

‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
-----------------

*   **Hallucinated / Fantasized Code**: The LLM sometimes fabricates or ‚Äúhallucinates‚Äù contract code that may not compile or make logical sense.
    
*   **Incomplete Edge Cases**: Certain flows may be only partially implemented or missing altogether.
    
*   **Deviation from Standards**: The generated ADO may deviate significantly from known, high-quality templates or standard practices.
    

üöß Possible Improvements
---------------------

*   **Refined Class Schemas** Structuring clearer class models to guide LLM precision.
    
*   **Price/Recall Matrix** Establishing robust evaluation metrics based on curated gold-standard datasets.
    
*   **Finetuning the LLM** Custom model training with domain-specific data to drastically reduce inaccuracies.
    
*   **Prompt Engineering** Systematic, step-by-step prompt structuring to ensure consistent and reliable outputs.
    
*   **Automated Testing** Incorporating automated compilation and testing processes, improving deployment reliability.
