LLM-based Smart Contract Generator
=======================

This repository hosts an open-source project that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform user intents, described in natural language, into Andromeda Digital Objects. The current system supports seven distinct ADO types—nft\_marketplace, crowdfund, cw20\_exchange, auction\_using\_cw20\_tokens, extended\_marketplace, commission\_based\_sales, and vesting\_and\_staking.

**Note**: The code generated by the LLM is currently of _limited quality_, often containing “hallucinations” or incomplete logic.

Project Overview
----------------

When building decentralized applications on Andromeda Protocol or similar platforms, developers frequently need to define and deploy — smart contracts tailored to their business needs. This project aims to:

*   Accept a user’s intent in natural language (e.g., “I want an NFT marketplace that charges a commission to sellers”).
    
*   Process that intent through a Large Language Model.
    
*   Output a first draft of an ADO that implements the specified behavior.
    
  

Available Generated Objects Types
-------------------

This project currently supports generating code for the following seven object types:

1.  **nft\_marketplace** An NFT marketplace that supports listing, selling, and buying NFTs.
    
2.  **crowdfund** A crowdfund contract that allows users to pledge tokens to reach a funding goal.
    
3.  **cw20\_exchange** A token exchange platform that swaps or trades native and CW20 tokens.
    
4.  **auction\_using\_cw20\_tokens** A timed or open auction mechanism utilizing CW20 tokens for bidding.
    
5.  **extended\_marketplace** A more feature-rich marketplace, potentially combining aspects of auctions, direct listings, and advanced settlement logic.
    
6.  **commission\_based\_sales** A marketplace or sales mechanism that withholds a commission from each sale for the contract operator.
    
7.  **vesting\_and\_staking** Contracts that manage locked or vested tokens and integrate staking functionality.

Known Limitations
-----------------

*   **Hallucinated / Fantasized Code**: The LLM sometimes fabricates or “hallucinates” contract code that may not compile or make logical sense.
    
*   **Incomplete Edge Cases**: Certain flows may be only partially implemented or missing altogether.
    
*   **Low Fidelity to Gold Standards**: The generated ADO may deviate significantly from known, high-quality templates or standard practices.
    

Possible Improvements
---------------------

1.  **Refined Class Schemas** By carefully structuring the prompts and the underlying contract class models, we can guide the LLM toward more accurate generation.
    
2.  **Price/Recall Matrix** Creating a thorough matrix or evaluation scheme around a high-quality gold dataset can give the LLM (or the system orchestrating the LLM) quantitative feedback on how close it is to correct solutions.
    
3.  **Finetuning the LLM** Instead of using a general-purpose LLM, training or finetuning on a curated dataset of ADO examples could dramatically reduce hallucinations and improve fidelity.
    
4.  **Prompt Engineering** Carefully engineering prompts—breaking them down into step-by-step instructions or providing more context—can help reduce randomness in the generated code.
    
5.  **Automated Testing** Creating automated tests or a staging environment where each generated contract is compiled and tested can catch many of the issues before they reach users.

We hope this LLM-based ADO Generator project helps you rapidly prototype ADOs for CosmWasm and beyond. We welcome criticism, feature requests, and pull requests—together, we can improve how decentralized applications get built!
