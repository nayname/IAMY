LLM-based Smart Contract Generator
=======================

This repository contains an open-source Web 3.0 project leveraging advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform user intents, expressed in natural language, into executable smart contracts known as Andromeda Digital Objects (ADOs). Accelerate your decentralized app development.

**Note**: The code generated by the LLM is currently of _limited quality_, often containing ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù or incomplete logic.

üìö Project Overview
----------------

When building decentralized applications on Andromeda Protocol, developers frequently need to define and deploy ‚Äî smart contracts tailored to their business needs. This project aims to:

*   Accept a user‚Äôs intent in natural language (e.g., ‚ÄúI want an NFT marketplace that charges a commission to sellers‚Äù).
    
*   Process that intent through a Large Language Model.
    
*   Output a first draft of an ADO that implements the specified behavior.
    
  

üß© Supported Object Types
-------------------

This project currently supports generating code for the following seven object types:

*   **nft\_marketplace** An NFT marketplace that supports listing, selling, and buying NFTs.
    
*   **crowdfund** A crowdfund contract that allows users to pledge tokens to reach a funding goal.
    
*   **cw20\_exchange** A token exchange platform that swaps or trades native and CW20 tokens.
    
*   **auction\_using\_cw20\_tokens** A timed or open auction mechanism utilizing CW20 tokens for bidding.
    
*   **extended\_marketplace** A more feature-rich marketplace, potentially combining aspects of auctions, direct listings, and advanced settlement logic.
    
*   **commission\_based\_sales** A marketplace or sales mechanism that withholds a commission from each sale for the contract operator.
    
*   **vesting\_and\_staking** Contracts that manage locked or vested tokens and integrate staking functionality.

‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
-----------------

*   **Hallucinated / Fantasized Code**: The LLM sometimes fabricates or ‚Äúhallucinates‚Äù contract code that may not compile or make logical sense.
    
*   **Incomplete Edge Cases**: Certain flows may be only partially implemented or missing altogether.
    
*   **Deviation from Standards**: The generated ADO may deviate significantly from known, high-quality templates or standard practices.
    

üöß Possible Improvements
---------------------

*   **Refined Class Schemas** Structuring clearer class models to guide LLM precision.
    
*   **Price/Recall Matrix** Establishing robust evaluation metrics based on curated gold-standard datasets.
    
*   **Finetuning the LLM** Custom model training with domain-specific data to drastically reduce inaccuracies.
    
*   **Prompt Engineering** Systematic, step-by-step prompt structuring to ensure consistent and reliable outputs.
    
*   **Automated Testing** Incorporating automated compilation and testing processes, improving deployment reliability.

We hope this LLM-based ADO Generator project helps you rapidly prototype ADOs for CosmWasm and beyond. We welcome criticism, feature requests, and pull requests‚Äîtogether, we can improve how decentralized applications get built!
