Project Roadmap
LLM-Based Smart Contract Generation with Deterministic Outputs
Our mission is to reliably enhance the quality, accuracy, and determinism of large language model (LLM) outputs, specifically tailored for financial services and blockchain smart-contract generation.

Phase 1: Foundation and Initial Integration 
Core Technology Development


Establish the initial LLM pipeline capable of translating natural-language intents into basic smart contracts.


Implement foundational accuracy measurement methodologies:


Quantitative benchmarking against public blockchain datasets.


Basic static analysis integration post-generation.


Initial Blockchain Integrations


Complete first-stage integration with Andromeda Protocol.


Establish preliminary collaboration agreements with Universa Blockchain (enterprise blockchain applications).


Early Data Collection


Begin systematic collection of initial public datasets (smart contracts, technical documents).


Initiate private dataset gathering (partner-specified user intents and requirements).



Phase 2: Accuracy Enhancement and Extended Integrations (Q4 2024-Q1 2025)
Advanced Accuracy and Determinism


Deploy advanced pre-inference strategies (synthetic data generation, fine-tuning models).


Refine post-inference methods:


Enhanced static code analysis.


Minimal expert human validation for critical scenarios.


Expanded Collaborations


Deepen integration with Universa Blockchain, progressing to pilot projects.


Formalize collaboration with key CosmWasm-based projects (leveraging modular architecture and community adoption).


Comprehensive Data Strategy


Standardize systematic benchmarking methodology for each use case scenario.


Build detailed repositories of contract-specific accuracy metrics and binary indicators (automation viability).



Phase 3: Product Maturity and Broad Market Entry (Q2-Q4 2025)
Automation and Security


Achieve significant automation coverage (clearly defined scenarios).


Establish robust guidelines for scenarios requiring human supervision.


Distribution Expansion


Leverage blockchain communities (Andromeda, Universa, CosmWasm) as entry points into broader financial services.


Engage additional blockchain ecosystems based on proven successes.


Data-Driven Differentiation (MOAT)


Aggregate and continually update specialized contract-generation datasets.


Implement user feedback loops to refine performance metrics and model configurations.



Phase 4: Scaling and Strategic Partnerships (2026+)
Scale to Complex Financial Use Cases


Extend functionality to support more sophisticated and regulated financial transactions.


Refine and optimize the balance between automation and human-in-the-loop validation.


Broader Industry Collaboration


Expand collaborations beyond blockchain infrastructure providers.


Engage traditional financial services organizations exploring blockchain or LLM-driven financial logic.


Continuous Innovation


Maintain a competitive edge by continuously improving accuracy, security, and reliability standards.


Develop proprietary tools and methodologies derived from accumulated unique data insights.
