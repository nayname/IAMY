LLM-Based Smart Contract Generation with Deterministic Outputs

Our mission is to reliably enhance the quality, accuracy, and determinism of large language model (LLM) outputs, specifically tailored for financial services and blockchain smart-contract generation.

----------

### Phase 1: Foundation and Initial Integration

-   Core Technology Development  
	-   Establish the initial LLM pipeline capable of translating natural-language intents into basic smart contracts.  
	-   Implement foundational accuracy measurement methodologies:  
		-   Quantitative benchmarking against public blockchain datasets.  
		-   Basic static analysis integration post-generation.  Integration of static analyzers and linters.
-   Initial Blockchain Integrations  
	- Initial pool of blockchain partners
-   Early Data Collection  
	-   Begin systematic collection of initial public datasets (smart contracts, technical documents).  
    -   Initiate private dataset gathering (partner-specified user intents and requirements).  
----------

### Phase 2: Accuracy Enhancement and Extended Integrations 

-   Advanced Accuracy and Determinism  
	-   Deploy advanced pre-inference strategies (synthetic data generation, fine-tuning models).  
	 -   Refine post-inference methods:  
		    -   Enhanced static code analysis.  Filling the gaps found in previous integrations of open-source  static tools.
	-   Minimal expert human validation for critical scenarios.  Estimated use cases, estimated percent of usage. Technical integration of human-in-the-loop.
 -   Comprehensive Data Strategy  
	  -   Standardize systematic benchmarking methodology for each use case scenario.  
      -   Build detailed repositories of contract-specific accuracy metrics and binary indicators (automation viability).  
  ----------

### Phase 3: Product Maturity and Broad Market Entry

-   Automation and Security  
	-   Achieve significant automation coverage (clearly defined scenarios).  
	-   Establish robust guidelines for scenarios requiring human supervision.  
-   Data-Driven Differentiation (MOAT)  
	-   Aggregate and continually update specialized contract-generation datasets.  
	-   Implement user feedback loops to refine performance metrics and model configurations.
